# gathertweet

The goal of gathertweet is to provide a simple command line utility that wraps key functions from [rtweet].

__gathertweet__ removes the boilerplate code required to run periodic Twitter searches and plays well with cron.

## Installation

This is a work in progress and may not work well for you yet.
But you are welcome to install **gathertweet** and try it out.

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gadenbuie/gathertweet")
```

Once you've installed the package, you need to run

```r
gathertweet::install_gathertweet()
```

which adds `gathertweet` to `/usr/local/bin` as a symlink (you can adjust were this link is created).

## Example

```bash
# Get 100 #rstats tweets
gathertweet search --n 100 --quiet "#rtats"

# Get more tweets, automatically starting from end of the last search
gathertweet search --n 100 --quiet "#rstats"

# Update the stored data about those #rstats tweets
gathertweet update
```

## Documentation

```{bash}
gathertweet --help
```
